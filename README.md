🎮 Hand Gesture Controlled Subway Surfers (Webcam-Based)
This project lets you play Subway Surfers (or similar running games) using hand gestures detected through your webcam — no keyboard needed!

🖐 Left Hand Gesture → Move Left
🖐 Right Hand Gesture → Move Right

The system uses computer vision to track hand movements in real-time and map them to game controls.

✨ Features
🎥 Webcam-based gesture detection
🎯 Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV / MediaPipe
🎮 Compatible with running games (Subway Surfers, Temple Run, etc.)
⚡ Fast response time for smooth gameplay
🖥 Works without additional hardware — just your webcam

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV for video processing
MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition
PyAutoGUI / Keyboard control libraries for key mapping

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository
Install dependencies from requirements.txt
Run python main.py
Open your game and start playing using gestures!
